#Pomodoro App

Overview

The Pomodoro App is a productivity tool designed to help users manage their time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It involves breaking work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

The Pomodoro App provides a digital implementation of the Pomodoro Technique, allowing users to set customizable timers for work sessions and breaks. It includes features such as session history tracking and a todo list.

Features

Customizable Timer: Users can set the duration of the main pomodoro timer, as well as short and long breaks.
Session History: Tracks previous work sessions, allowing users to review their productivity over time.
Todo List: Provides a simple todo list for keeping track of tasks during work sessions.
Responsive Design: The app is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent user experience across devices.
Sticky Navbar: The navigation bar remains fixed at the top of the screen as the user scrolls, providing easy access to different sections of the app.
